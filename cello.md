Cello lessons are individual. Content of lessons depends on age of students, ability to learn, on level (in case that they have already some music experience or directly with cello) and also on their expectations.
 
We can start from the beginning, it means students learns about parts of cello and their functions, holding of the instrument, they play at first in basic positions and pizzicato (plucking) and after they adopt way of playing with bow. If student is advanced, he/she is developing already gained skills and learns more demanding compositions, songs or techniques.
 
 
What you or you child can expect during lessons with me?
classics (scales, chords, etudes, exercises for right and/or left hand)
compositions (from simple one-line songs to Swan or famous concerts)
improvisation (playing melodies “according ear”, creation of accompaniments in different musical styles)
singing (yes, singing! :) of songs with own accompaniment on cello)
duets (for two cellos or I gladly prepare arrangement for cello and any other instrument)
happiness and entertainment from playing of favourite melodies (do you like soundtracks from Twilight or Harry Potter? Are you fan of Star Wars? Everything is possible!)
