Music education is always about cooperation and co-playing and that’s why we discuss with my students and their parents what they would like to learn, what is their idea of music lesson, what caught their interest in the music area, but I also keep good development by using proven teaching methods.
I engage the motto of Czech ancient teacher Comenius “School is play”, and thanks to that students study not only technique of playing an instrument or a theory, but they use also gained skills and knowledge in practice, for example during improvisation. With the children we also play games and quizzes so they enjoy the process of learning. Because of Brussels being such a multicultural city and my student’s encounter with many outside phenomena, I use that advantage during lessons and we learn, for example, a foreign nation’s songs or special techniques of playing an instrument.
To learn something new, even though as a child or an adult, regularity is required. That’s why I prefer to work with my students once per week and in case of interest, even more often. Please remember that half an hour or an hour spent with a teacher is basic in learning process, which is necessary to complete with practicing instrument or memorizing information alone, ideally every day:


-> Child + beginner = minimally 10 min.

-> Adult + beginner = 30 min.

-> Child + advanced = 30 min.

-> Adult + advanced = no time limit :)

<!-- <table>
    <tr>
        <td>Child + beginner = minimally 10 min.</td>
        <td>Adult + beginner = 30 min.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Child + advanced = 30 min.</td>
        <td>Adult + advanced = no time limit :)</td>
    </tr>
</table> -->

If you or your child doesn’t have enough time to practice every day, it is sufficient to play at least three times per week.


## Cello Lessons
Cello lessons are individual. Content of lessons depends on age of students, ability to learn, on level (in case that they have already some music experience or directly with cello) and also on their expectations.
We can start from the beginning, it means students learns about parts of cello and their functions, holding of the instrument, they play at first in basic positions and pizzicato (plucking) and after they adopt way of playing with bow. If student is advanced, he/she is developing already gained skills and learns more demanding compositions, songs or techniques.

#### What you or your child can expect during lessons with me?
-> classics (scales, chords, etudes, exercises for right and/or left hand)

-> compositions (from simple one-line songs to Swan or famous concerts)

-> improvisation (playing melodies “according ear”, creation of accompaniments in different musical styles)

-> singing (yes, singing! :) of songs with own accompaniment on cello)

-> duets (for two cellos or I gladly prepare arrangement for cello and any other instrument)

-> happiness and entertainment from playing of favourite melodies (do you like soundtracks from Twilight or Harry Potter? Are you fan of Star Wars? Everything is possible!)

## Piano For Beginners
Piano lessons are individual. Content of lessons depends on age of student, ability to learn and on their expectations. Students get acquainted with piano (or keyboard and its functions), I explain the system of keys and pedals. Students start to play by one hand, after by both hands. We are developing playing melodically (and not only in right hand) with simple accompaniment, later on more complicated one.

#### What you or your child can expect during lessons with me?
-> classics (scales, chords, etudes, exercises for right and/or left hand)

-> compositions (from simple one-line songs to Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonate)

-> improvisation (playing melodies “according ear”, creation of accompaniments in different musical styles)

-> singing (yes, singing! :) of songs with own accompaniment on piano)

->  four-hands pieces

-> happiness and entertainment from playing your favourite melodies (do you like soundtracks from Twilight or Harry Potter? Are you fan of Star Wars? Everything is possible!

## Music Theory and/or Music History
Music theory and/or music history lessons are individual or collective. We are listening to recordings, clapping rhythmical exercises, singing, reading, talking, playing music games, and writing down musical dictates...
Learning about music theory and history helps you or your child to quicken progress of learning to play an instrument, and because of that I always recommend both, lessons of cello or piano and also music theory and history.

#### What you or your child can expect during lessons with me?
-> basics (staff/stave, musical clefs, names and positions of notes, note’s lengths, types of measures, intervals, scales, chords...)

-> music instruments

-> music styles

-> info about music composers

-> info about musicians, interprets of both classical and popular music

In French called „Eveil musical“ the Introduction to music is collective lesson for children of pre-school age (2,5-6 years). All activities lead to child’s movements development as well as to basic understanding of music.

#### What your child can expect during lessons with me?
-> singing, learning new songs

-> rhythmics (using the body or rhythmical instruments)

-> dancing

-> musical games

-> by music accompanied drawing, painting

-> by music accompanied relaxation
