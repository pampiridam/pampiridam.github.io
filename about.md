### ZUZANA GJERDINGEN

Currently I am teaching collective and individual music lessons for <a href="https://apeeeb3.be/extracurricular-activities/individual-music-lessons" target="_blank">the Association of Parents at European School of Brussels in Ixelles</a> and assisting in Czech Nursery Class of EEB3. 

Something about me: 

As main or substitute teacher I gave cello lessons and music theory (group classes) at Basic Music Schools in Frýdek-Místek and Vratimov and from 2007 I am active as private teacher of cello, music theory, music history and piano for beginners (see more in section Lessons). In past I had been cooperating with Ateliers Stani and teaching private lessons all around Brussels.
 
For a several years I had played with Charlotte Barbier in Brussels Cello Duo during private and company events, also performed as soloist and member of chamber ensembles, bands, orchestras and choirs, at concerts in Czech Republic, Slovak Republic Poland, Austria, Belgium and France. Apart from classical music, I had been always active in the area of popular music (folk, rock and pop bands, drum’n’bass project), participated in the creation of two CD’s (Tauranga – Poznání, 2005; Slepí Křováci – Prasátko a jiné bajky, 2010).

Born in 1985, I began to learn playing the cello at the age of eleven in Basic Music School Frýdek-Místek, Czech Republic, then entered the Janáček’s Conservatory in Ostrava in the class of Jiří Zedníček (Kubín Quartet), where I successfully finished in 2007. That same year I started bachelor studies at the Academy of Music and Performing Arts in Bratislava, Slovakia, in the class of doc. Ján Slávik, ArtD. (Moyzes Quartet, Slovak Philharmonic Orchestra) and in 2010 entered class of Viviane Spanoghe at Koninklijk Conservatorium Brussel, where I completed her education with a Master in Music diploma in 2013.
 
I participated in master-classes of prof. Jozef Podhoranský and Viviane Spanoghe, attended the Koninklijk Conservatorium Brussel for five months via the Erasmus exchange study (2009) and also graduated in Additional Pedagogical Studies (2010) at the Academy of Music and Performing Arts in Bratislava.
 
For her studies I had received several scholarships, including those from the Endowment Fund of Lívie and Václav Klaus in the academic year 2009-2010, the Endowment Fund of Rotary Club Ostrava (2010), the Czech Music Fund (2010-2011 and 2011-2012), Endowment The Life of an Artist (2009, 2010 and 2012) and Endowment For Development of Education (2009, 2012). 





<!-- Yes, that’s true! My private music school PAMPIRIDAM is really for everybody, for children and adults! And why is it? Because I prepare lessons which fits exactly your expectations!
 
Music education is always about cooperation and co-playing, and that’s why with my students (and parents) we discuss what they would like to learn, what is their idea of music lesson, what caught their interest in the music area, but I also keep good development by using proven teaching methods.
 
I engage the motto of Czech ancient teacher [Comenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Amos_Comenius) “School is play”, and thanks to that students study not only technique of playing an instrument or a theory, but they use also gained skills and knowledge in practice, for example during improvisation. And with children we play also games and quiz so they enjoy process of learning.
 
Because of Brussels being multicultural city and my student’s encounter with many outside phenomena, I use that advantage during lessons and we learn, for example, foreign nation’s songs or special techniques of playing an instrument.
 
To learn something new, even though little or adult person, regularity is required. That’s why I prefer to work with my students once per week, in case of interest even more often. Please, remember, that half an hour or hour spent with teacher is basic in learning process, which is necessary to complete with practicing instrument or memorizing information alone...

Ideally every day (child + beginner = minimally 10 min., adult + beginner = 30 min., child + advanced = 30 min., adult + advanced = no time limit :) ). If you or your child doesn’t have enough time to practice every day, it is sufficient to play at least three times per week. -->
