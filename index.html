<h1>A music school for everyone!</h1>
<p>Yes, that’s true! My private music school PAMPIRIDAM is really for everybody - for children as well as adults! And why is it? Because I prepare lessons that fits exactly your expectations!</p>

<h4>Does your child play an instrument but needs a bit of music theory to speed up?</h4>
<p>Inscribe him or her for the Music theory course for school-children at Czech School Without Borders in Ixelles (only in Czech/Slovak speaking). For more info go to <a href="www.csbh-brusel.be/">Czech School Without Borders - &#268;SBH</a></p>

<h4>Cooperation with Ateliers Stani</h4>
<p>Inscribe you for the „Eveil musical“ in <a href="http://www.ateliersstani.com">Ateliers Stani</a>!</p>

<h4>Eveil musical also now at EEB3!</h4>
<p>For more info go to <a href="http://www.eeb3.eu/" target="_blank">European School Brussels III - EEB3</a></p>
