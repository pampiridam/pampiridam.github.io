Yes, that’s true! My private music school PAMPIRIDAM is really for everybody, for children and adults! And why is it? Because I prepare lessons which fits exactly your expectations!
 
Music education is always about cooperation and co-playing, and that’s why with my students (and parents) we discuss what they would like to learn, what is their idea of music lesson, what caught their interest in the music area, but I also keep good development by using proven teaching methods.
 
I engage the motto of Czech ancient teacher [Comenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Amos_Comenius) “School is play”, and thanks to that students study not only technique of playing an instrument or a theory, but they use also gained skills and knowledge in practice, for example during improvisation. And with children we play also games and quiz so they enjoy process of learning.
 
Because of Brussels being multicultural city and my student’s encounter with many outside phenomena, I use that advantage during lessons and we learn, for example, foreign nation’s songs or special techniques of playing an instrument.
 
To learn something new, even though little or adult person, regularity is required. That’s why I prefer to work with my students once per week, in case of interest even more often. Please, remember, that half an hour or hour spent with teacher is basic in learning process, which is necessary to complete with practicing instrument or memorizing information alone...

Ideally every day (child + beginner = minimally 10 min., adult + beginner = 30 min., child + advanced = 30 min., adult + advanced = no time limit :) ). If you or your child doesn’t have enough time to practice every day, it is sufficient to play at least three times per week.
