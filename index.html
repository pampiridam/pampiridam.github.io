Yes, that’s true! My private music school PAMPIRIDAM is really for everybody - for children as well as adults! And why is it? Because I prepare lessons that fits exactly your expectations!

- Does your child play an instrument but needs a bit of music theory to speed up? Inscribe him or her for the Music theory course for school-children at Czech School Without Borders in Ixelles (only in Czech/Slovak speaking). For more info click HERE. (Link to the sub-page Cooperation with CSBH)

- Inscribe you for the „Eveil musical“ in Ateliers Stani! For more info click HERE. (Link to the sub-page Cooperation with Ateliers Stani)
